# jpeg-notebook

This project is designed to help understand the process of JPEG compression. In order to do so, it takes advantage of Python execution within the Jupyter Notebook environment. To get started, pull down this repository and make sure all of the necessary Python libraries are installed using the included **requirements.txt** file.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
After the libraries and their dependencies are installed, you can start Jupyter with the following command:

    jupyter-notebook
    
A new window should open in your browser showing the base folder of the project. From there, click on the "JPEG_Analysis.ipynb" to view the JPEG notebook.
